# Conclusion
* City hotel was booked most by the customer so we should spend most targeting 
fund in these hotel.
 The population booked the City hotel more than 60% .

* We should target the month between July and August as this was peak month due to summer period.And the least bookings were made at the start and end of the year. In the year 2016 bookings more than double ,compared to the previous year.  But the bookings decreased by almost 15% in that year 2017.
  
* Total number of bookings were canceled around 37%.

* Majority of the guests are from Western Europe. We should spend a significant amount of our budget on those area.Portugal(PRT), the UK, and France(FRA), Spain and Germany are the top countries from most guests come, more than 80% come from these 5 countries.

* We also saw that due to no deposit policy, cancelation of booking was more.

* As repeated guest is less, so we should target our advertisement on guests to increase returning guests.

# From the discussion above, it can be concluded that the recommendations that can be made are:

1. Further review is welcome regarding the cause of the guest who canceled the booking.

2. Have a discount/promo in November-January

3. To adjust the number of hotel guests, you can hire contract employees during peak months.

4. It is recommended that the hotel can adjust its hotel culture according to the habits of the guest country, such as making food that tastes acceptable to guests from other countries.

5. It is recommended that marketing from 5 dominant countries (Portugal, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, and France) be optimized to increase the number of visitors.
